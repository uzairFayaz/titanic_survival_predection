# Titanic Survival Prediction Documentation

## 1. **Importing Libraries**

### Code:
```python
# Importing All Required Libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from warnings import filterwarnings
filterwarnings(action='ignore')
```

### Purpose:
- Imports essential libraries for data manipulation (`pandas`, `numpy`) and visualization (`matplotlib`).
- Suppresses warnings to streamline the output.

---

## 2. **Loading Datasets**

### Code:
```python
# Loading Datasets
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', 10, 'display.width', 1000)
train = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
test = pd.read_csv('test.csv')
train.head()
```

### Purpose:
- Reads the training and testing datasets from CSV files into pandas DataFrames.
- Adjusts display options for better readability of DataFrame outputs.
- Displays the first few rows of the training dataset for a quick overview.

---

## 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### Dataset Shape:
```python
# Display shape
train.shape
```
- Outputs the number of rows and columns in the training dataset.

### Observations:
- **Rows:** 891
- **Columns:** 12

## 4. **Data Preprocessing**
Details about handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering are covered later in the notebook. (Placeholder for additional steps once reviewed.)

---

## 5. **Model Building**
The notebook implements a machine learning pipeline using `RandomForestClassifier` from scikit-learn to predict survival. It involves splitting data, training the model, and evaluating performance metrics like confusion matrix and classification report.

---

## 6. **Visualization**
Matplotlib is used to create visualizations (plots to be detailed once reviewed).

---

### Next Steps:
- Finalize preprocessing steps and model evaluation details.
- Add summary metrics and insights derived from the analysis.
